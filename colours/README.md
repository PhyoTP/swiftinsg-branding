# Guidelines
## Brand Colour
- Orange is the primary brand colour.
- Yellow is the secondary brand colour.

### Colour Considerations
- Prioritise readability and legibility.
  - Use black/white as opposed to brand colours if going with brand colours might affect legibility.
- Test out the colours on the intended platform/medium.
  - Colours may appear different on a device screen and when printed out.
  - Make sure to do tests to ensure that the brand colours appear as intended regardless of the platform/medium it is viewed on.
  - This is especially important to ensure text legibility.

## Brand Gradient
Gradients can add depth, visual interest, and a sense of dynamism. When used effectively, gradients can enhance the overall visual experience and evoke the brand's personality.

- Apply the Brand Gradient on a large area.
  - On a small area, a solid colour is preferred.
  - The definition of "small" and "large" is subjective and largely based on the design. 
- There should only be 2 colour stops on the standard gradient.
- Feel free to adjust the colours to make sure the gradient looks good on the platform it is viewed on, while still maintaining the theme.
  - E.g. The brand gradient might need to be optimised for printing on specific surfaces (like a water bottle), or the gradient might appear too bright on certain platforms.
- Use sparingly.
  - Do not overuse the brand gradient as it may create a "messy" end-product.
- Take into account accessiblity.
  - Ensure that, when the gradient is used, any text remains legible.
  - If not, a solid colour will be preferred.
